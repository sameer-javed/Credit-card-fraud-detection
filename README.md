# ðŸš¨ Tackling Credit Card Fraud with Predictive Modeling! ðŸ’³ðŸ“Š

Excited to share my recent work on developing a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System**! This project leverages the power of **Logistic Regression** and data science techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions and improve financial security.

## What I Did:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled class imbalance (a common challenge in fraud detection) by balancing the dataset for better model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transformed key features to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.
- **Model Building**: Developed a robust **Logistic Regression** model to detect fraudulent patterns with high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Web App**: Built an interactive web application using **Streamlit** to enable real-time input and fraud prediction through a user-friendly interface in a Chrome browser.

## Project Highlights:
This project demonstrates how **data science** and **web technologies** can combine to tackle real-world problems and enhance financial security. The model was trained to handle imbalanced data, which is a critical issue in fraud detection scenarios. The **Streamlit app** allows users to interact with the model, input transaction data, and get instant fraud detection results.

## Technology Stack:
- **Logistic Regression**: For predictive modeling and identifying fraudulent transactions.
- **Python**: Used for data processing, model training, and building the backend logic.
- **Pandas & Scikit-learn**: For data handling, balancing, feature transformation, and model building.
- **Streamlit**: To develop a simple and interactive web interface for real-time fraud detection.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
