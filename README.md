# ðŸš¨ Tackling Credit Card Fraud with Predictive Modeling! ðŸ’³ðŸ“Š

Excited to share my recent work on developing a Credit Card Fraud Detection System! By balancing and transforming the dataset, Iâ€™ve built a powerful predictive model using Logistic Regression that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions.

What I did:

Preprocessed and balanced the data to handle the class imbalance (a common challenge in fraud detection).
Transformed key features for better prediction.
Built a robust Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent patterns with great accuracy.
Developed an interactive Streamlit web app to allow real-time input to the model via a simple and user-friendly Chrome browser interface.
This project demonstrates how data science and web technologies can combine to tackle real-world problems and enhance financial security. ðŸš€
